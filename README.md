# Angular Routing Example
This example has a `Home` page that routes to a set of tabs in a page called `Menu`.
This demonstrates the `IonWillEnter` and `IonWillLeave` events that occur when routing from `Home` to `Menu` as well as how pages keep state with routing between tabs but lose that state when routing tabs.
